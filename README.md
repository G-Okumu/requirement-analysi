# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves gathering, analyzing, validating, and documenting the requirements for a software project. It defines what the system should do, who will use it, and how it should perform, without detailing how to implement it technically.

## Detailed Explanation
Requirement Analysis is the process of understanding the exact needs and expectations of stakeholders (clients, users, and others involved) to build a system that solves their problems or fulfills their goals. It acts as a foundation for all subsequent phases of software development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
### Requirement Gathering:
Collecting requirements from stakeholders using techniques like interviews, questionnaires, observation, brainstorming, and document analysis.

### Requirement Elicitation:
Drawing out the true needs, including unstated or hidden requirements, through discussions and analysis.

### Requirement Specification:
Documenting requirements in a structured format, typically using an SRS (Software Requirements Specification) document.

### Requirement Validation:
Ensuring the requirements are correct, complete, unambiguous, and agreed upon by all stakeholders.

### Requirement Prioritization:
Ranking requirements based on business value, urgency, cost, or risk.

### Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
- Provides a clear roadmap for developers and designers to build the system.
- Clearly defined requirements prevent unnecessary features or changes later in the project.
- Ensures all stakeholders have a shared understanding of the project's goals.
- Early identification of incorrect or incomplete requirements saves time and money during later stages.
